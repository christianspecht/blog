When I figured out [how to create an image gallery with Hugo and Lightbox2]({{< ref "/posts/2020-08-10-creating-an-image-gallery-with-hugo-and-lightbox2/index.md" >}}), there's one thing I left out: image captions.

In Lightbox2 itself, this is straightforward. Here's the generated HTML from the current version of my Hugo/Lightbox2 gallery, for one single image *(image URLs shortened for brevity)*:

    <a href="path/to/image.jpg" data-lightbox="x"><img src="path/to/thumbnail.jpg" /></a>

To add a caption, you just add a `data-title` attribute:

    <a href="path/to/image.jpg" data-lightbox="x" data-title="My caption"><img src="path/to/thumbnail.jpg" /></a>

In my previous image gallery attempts with Jekyll, the list of images always came from a YAML list *(either [from a data file]({{< ref "/posts/2014-03-08-generating-an-image-gallery-with-jekyll-and-lightbox2/index.md" >}}) or [directly from the respective page's frontmatter]({{< ref "/posts/2014-08-22-jekyll-lightbox2-image-gallery-another-approach/index.md" >}}))*.  
In both cases, the list just had an additional property for the caption, which I used to fill the caption in the HTML attribute.

But in my Hugo gallery, the images are [page resources](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-resources/), i.e. there is no actual "list of images" defined anywhere. The image files are stored in a subdirectory of the post, and Hugo reads them directly from the file system.  
So it's not obvious how/where to store captions per image - that's why I omitted them in the first version of my Hugo gallery.

As a reminder/comparison, here's the current version of the line from the shortcode that generates the `<a>` tag:

    <a href="{{ .Permalink }}" data-lightbox="x"><img src="{{ $resized.Permalink }}" /></a>

*(for the full shortcode, see the [previous post]({{< ref "/posts/2020-08-10-creating-an-image-gallery-with-hugo-and-lightbox2/index.md" >}}))*

### Solution: Hugo and EXIF data

I wasn't even aware that Hugo is able to access the EXIF data of images. I found it out by accident when reading [this discussion in the Hugo forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/exif-iptc/25995).

First of all, how to edit an image's EXIF data? There are probably many tools that can do this, but on Windows 10 *(where I'm writing this text right now)* you don't even need a tool, Windows Explorer is enough:

1. Right-click on an image in the Explorer â‡’ Properties
2. Go to the `Details` tab and write the caption into the `Title` field:

    ![Edit EXIF in Windows Explorer](/img/hugo-gallery-exif.png)

To show this caption in the Hugo image gallery, the line in the shortcode must look like this:

    <a href="{{ .Permalink }}" data-lightbox="x" data-title="{{ with .Exif }}{{ .Tags.ImageDescription }}{{ end }}"><img src="{{ $resized.Permalink }}" /></a>

[New commit with the changes](https://github.com/christianspecht/code-examples/commit/425418fef8e2ef27c1b9b89ea691eb19cfceff1a) *(shortcode and one image)*, in the existing example project in the `code-examples` repo.


That's all - *one* changed line of code.  
The more I learn about Hugo, the more I like it. As I said in the previous post: IMO the learning curve is insanely steep in the beginning, but apparently I have the hardest part behind me now. Now I'm at the stage where I'm amazed what Hugo can do with very little code.

### Alternative solution: load captions from page's front matter

This is the first solution I had, before finding out about Hugo's EXIF feature. It works, but I like the EXIF solution better.  
But for the sake of completeness, I wanted to show this solution as well.

Similar to my [second Jekyll gallery]({{< ref "/posts/2014-08-22-jekyll-lightbox2-image-gallery-another-approach/index.md" >}}), the list of captions is coming from the page's front matter: 

	resources:
	- src: "img/Pope-Edouard-de-Beaumont-1844.jpg"
	  title: "Example caption 1"
	- src: "img/esmeralda.jpg"
	  title: "Example caption 2"

Note that the list must also contain the image's name/path, so Hugo knows which text belongs to which image. 

Then, the line in the shortcode must be changed like this to show the caption:

    <a href="{{ .Permalink }}" data-lightbox="x" {{ if ne .Title .Name }}data-title="{{ .Title }}"{{ end }}><img src="{{ $resized.Permalink }}" /></a>

This works, but I didn't like it because a) the data for the image gallery is now spread across two places *(file system and front matter)* and b) I have to duplicate the file name of each image in the front-matter again.

**What I needed:**

A web site to feature my projects and *(maybe)* a blog. I registered the domain years ago, but never had a site until then.

**What I learned:**

- Setting up [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) on rented webspace
- Displaying [Markdown files from my Bitbucket projects in WordPress]({{< ref "/posts/2012-03-09-how-to-display-markdown-files-from-other-sites-in-wordpress/index.md" >}})

**What I needed:**

An informational website for an annual garage sale in my home town. Requirements:

- Sellers should be able to register with their addresses and pay via PayPal
- A list of registered adresses and a Google map with markers should be re-created daily via cronjob

**What I learned:**

- Building a static [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site with dynamic PHP parts, and [running it locally under XAMPP]({{< ref "/posts/2017-10-04-running-a-combined-jekyll-php-site-on-xampp/index.md" >}})
- [Implementing](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44202971/6884) and [troubleshooting](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43955343/6884) a PayPal "Pay now" button
- Creating files for the Google map *(based on [this one]({{< ref "/posts/2015-01-22-creating-a-holiday-map-in-google-maps/index.md" >}}))* and the address list with [Mustache.php](https://github.com/bobthecow/mustache.php)
- Creating [a map for printing with custom map tiles]({{< ref "/posts/2019-08-29-creating-custom-openstreetmap-tiles-for-my-own-tile-server/index.md" >}}) with [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) and [Maperitive](http://maperitive.net/)

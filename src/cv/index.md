The "CV" link in the sidebar *used* to link directly to my Stack Overflow Developer Story (`https://stackoverflow.com/cv/christianspecht`), the only online CV that I had for years.

Unfortunately SO [decided to discontinue it](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/415293/6884), so for now here's the last version as a PDF file:  
[CV Christian Specht](cv-christian-specht.pdf)

My Developer story also had a nice introductory text, which is unfortunately missing in the PDF export, so I'm adding it here:

> In-house developer and DBA at [weinor](https://www.weinor.de/), a mid-sized manufacturing company in Cologne, Germany. We produce high quality awnings, conservatory roofs and window shades.
> 
> My main job is [Enterprise Development](https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/posts/what-is-enterprise-development/):  
> Maintaining and supporting the company's in-house ERP system and adding new features to it.
> 
> Plus, I'm also the DBA and general database go-to guy for our ERP system database as well as all other databases, including those belonging to 3rd party tools.
> 
> The systems I develop and maintain are essential for daily operations and enable over 300 people to sell, produce and ship awnings and conservatories worth many millions of â‚¬ per year.

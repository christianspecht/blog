I missed the exact date by a few days, but [ten years ago I wrote my first post here]({% post_url 2012-03-09-how-to-display-markdown-files-from-other-sites-in-wordpress %}).

It doesn't feel like I wrote *that* much in that time, but it's actually almost 50 posts (this one is number 47).

Realizing that I've been running this site for a decade made me think about the time before that...how I ended up from *"I'm a helpdesk guy starting to learn software development" (2002)* to *"I'm now writing a blog about software development" (2012)*:

- 2002: Got started writing MS Access/VBA code (and for the first few years, I was a [Dark Matter developer](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/dark-matter-developers-the-unseen-99))
- 2007: Started learning .NET (and ASP.NET WebForms), had to google *a lot*, found that there are many developers writing blogs about software development, and started reading all of them
- 2008: Discovered Stack Overflow when it was brand new ([my user id has only 4 digits](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6884/christian-specht)) and realized that there's still **a lot** that I don't know.  
	- At the time I was participating in some German-speaking discussion forums about software development, but decided to focus on Stack Overflow to improve my English
- 2011: Made [my first commit in my first open source project](https://github.com/christianspecht/roboshell-backup/commit/e83e53f814fc8a5bb02266ce5e5a56be28d6ca63) (it's on GitHub *now*, but at that time it was a Mercurial repo on Bitbucket, even before Bitbucket added support for Git)
- 2012: As already mentioned above, created this site (in WordPress, back then) and wrote the first post here

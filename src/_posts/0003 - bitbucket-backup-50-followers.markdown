As of today, [Bitbucket Backup](http://christianspecht.de/bitbucket-backup/) has hit the 50 follower mark on Bitbucket:

![50 followers](/img/bbb-50-followers.png "50 followers")

Of course, 50 followers isn’t that much, given that other projects on Bitbucket have several hundreds, and some other projects (on GitHub, for example) have several **thousands**.

But for a project that is just about nine months old, written by a guy virtually unknown in the OSS community, it’s not that bad :-)

Most of the followers probably heard about Bitbucket Backup because it’s on Bitbucket’s [“Featured Repositories” list](https://bitbucket.org/explore) for quite some time now.
So many thanks to the guys at Bitbucket for advertising my project on their site!

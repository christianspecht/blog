#### What I needed:

Convert existing batch files for [Robocopy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy) backups (*computer→NAS* and *NAS→USB disk*) to a more comfortable tool, with all settings in a config file.

#### What I learned:

- [Windows PowerShell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell) basics
- [Building a setup with WiX](http://wixtoolset.org/)
- Using [TrueCrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt) and [integrating it into RoboShell Backup](/2012/04/30/roboshell-backup-1-1-now-with-truecrypt-integration/)

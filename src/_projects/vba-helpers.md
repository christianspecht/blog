**What I needed:**

A reusable library of VBA helper functions, to avoid having slight variations of the same functions duplicated across several projects.

**What I learned:**

- Unit testing in VBA with [AccUnit](http://accunit.access-codelib.net) and [SimplyVBUnit](http://sourceforge.net/projects/simplyvbunit/)
